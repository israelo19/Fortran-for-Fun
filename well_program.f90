! This is a program that will take in a well file, prompt the user for a well number and then generate a random pumping rate number from 100 to 5000
! and then update that well with the generated pumping rate.

integer :: well_num, i, seed, lower_bound = 100, upper_bound = 5000
real :: pumping_rate

seed = 1919161
call srand(seed)








end program well
